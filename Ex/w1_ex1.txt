a) No, Data mining is not another hype. Instead, the need for data mining hasarisen due to the wide availability of huge amounts of data and the imminent need for turning such data, into useful information and knowledge. Thus, datamining can be viewed as the result of the natural evolution of information technology. Itâ€™s a reality and it has great present and bright future. Data mining is one of the most widely used methods to extract data from different sources and organize them for better usage
b) 
 No. Data mining is not a simple transformation of technology developed from databases, statistics, and machine learning. Instead, it involves an integration of
data rather than a simple transformation of techniques from multiple disciplines such as database technology, statistics, machine learning, high-performance computing, pattern recognition, neural networks, data visualization, and information retrieval and so on.

c) Data mining is not an advancement in the field of machine learning. Data Numerous technologies, including statistics, machine learning, data warehousing, pattern recognition, etc. The method of data mining is identifying patterns in massive data sets to obtain insightful data for action depending on the analysis, make decisions.

Similar to knowledge discovery is data mining on a vast scale. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being implemented into machine learning systems that allow computers to learn from their experiences.

RDBMS (Relational Database management systems (DMS) have progressed from straightforward file processing structured data storage, retrieval, transaction processing, etc relations.

Data formats have evolved into new formats as a result of once in a while. Examples include audio and video files, log messages, tweets, high-density data, and more.

The quantity of data, formats, and database operations have expanded, and changed. This made it possible to mine enormous amounts of data.
